"""
Unsourced-figure detection (ML-058, Sprint 2 Week 2).

Internal Test 2 found the system stating specific statistics that could not be
traced to any cited source. ``_SLIM_BASE_PROMPT`` already says "Never invent
statistics" -- but that is an instruction, not an enforcement. This module is
the enforcement half: after generation, check whether the numbers in the answer
actually appear in the evidence that was cited.

Design stance -- deliberately conservative, mirroring
``looks_like_degenerate_repetition``:

* Flag, never delete. Removing figures from otherwise-correct prose risks
  mangling good answers; a caveat plus an ACF cap is the honest signal.
* Skip number shapes that are not factual claims (years, list markers,
  section numbers, percentages already attached to a cited figure).
* A false positive on every answer would be worse than the bug, so matching
  is generous: digit-normalised substring matching against the full cited
  text, tolerant of thousands separators and decimal noise.

This cannot catch a hallucinated figure that happens to appear somewhere in a
cited chunk, and it does not verify that a number was used in the right
*context*. It catches the blatant case -- a figure with no basis in the
evidence at all.
